abstract: "This paper is a use case report for the population architecture of a commercial Knowledge Graph. We introduce our pilots and
their focus within the MindLab Project, which aims to build Knowledge
Graphs with a lifecycle-based approach to enable conversational agents.
We describe and evaluate our pipeline for the first step of the lifecycle,
namely Knowledge Creation. Our approach satisfies all defined requirements in terms of provenance tracking, scalability, and usability."
